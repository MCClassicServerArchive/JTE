This server requires a Perl distribution (ActivePerl or Strawberry Perl will both work fine for Windows) to run. The command is: perl core.pl
The console is non-interactive (sorry) but you can use the /hide command to pretend you're not connected anyway if you like.
Check config.txt to configure the server, command.pl to change the admin levels required to use certain commands.
Level 200 admins have access to everything by defualt, including the /admin <person> <level> command which can be used to set others to any specific level. /op and /deop are considered level 100.
Some commands allow different things to different admin levels, most notably the /build command allows different things to be built. (Only level 200 admins can build active water and lava by default, though watervator is available to all.)
If you need help porting a map to this server, let me know and I'll gladly do it for you.
